I am using the square-connect library, and when creating an item, my price is being truncated. For instance, if I set my item price to be 123.13, what comes out is 1.23. 

Here is an example of my code:
    
    squareRouter.post('/item', function(req, res){
  	var item = req.body.item;
  	console.log(item);
  	square.api('/me/items', 'POST', item, function(err, resp){
  		data_handler(err, resp, res);
  	  });
    });

in the console window, here is my item object:

    { variations: { 
        pricing_type: 'FIXED_PRICING',
        price_money: { currency_code: 'USD', amount: 123.13 },
        name: 'Small' },
    name: 'The Real test',
    description: 'The price of this should be $123.13',
    visibility: true,
    available_online: true,
    available_for_pickup: true }

but in my dashboard, ![enter image description here][1]

I am using the square-connect npm module available here:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/square-connect

I have the ugly feeling this is a bug in the npm module, not something I'm doing, but I've very very rarely found this to be true in practice. Am I missing something here, or do I need to find the violating code in the library and fix it?
